# Security Policy

## The threat model you should understand before running this

mcpfabric intentionally gives an AI agent **operator-level control** over Minecraft: running
arbitrary commands, editing the world, moving and managing players, and reading the screen. The
mod exposes this through a local HTTP bridge.

By design, the bridge:

- binds to **`127.0.0.1` only**, and
- requires a **bearer token** (printed once in the log and stored in `config/mcpfabric.config.json`).

Treat the token like a password. Anyone who can reach the bridge and present the token can do
anything an operator can do. Do **not** expose the bridge to other interfaces or forward the port
without putting an authenticated reverse proxy in front of it, and understand that doing so hands
remote control of your game to whoever holds the token.

You can narrow what the bridge allows with the `enable*` flags in `config/mcpfabric.config.json`
(`enableWorldWrite`, `enableCommands`, `enablePlayerControl`, `enableVision`).

## Supported versions

Security fixes target the latest release and the currently supported Minecraft version range
declared in `settings.gradle`. Older builds are not back-patched.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** — do not open a public issue for anything exploitable.

- Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/denfry/mcpfabric/security/advisories/new)
  ("Report a vulnerability"), or
- email the maintainer at the address on their GitHub profile.

Include a description, affected versions, and reproduction steps. You can expect an initial
response within a few days. Please give a reasonable window to ship a fix before public disclosure.
